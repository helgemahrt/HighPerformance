# HighPerformance
High performance .NET Core utility classes I use in my development.

So far there are the following utilities:
* Splitter - allows splitting strings by an arbitrary character (e.g. by the new-line character)
* StreamParser - allows splitting streams using Splitter (e.g. to extract lines)
* JsonTokenizer - forward-only JSON parsing
